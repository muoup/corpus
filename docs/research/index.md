# Research Index

This section contains stream-of-consciousness notes, experimental findings, and conceptual explorations.

## Philosophy

Research documents are **soft-text** - they represent:
- In-progress exploration and thought processes
- Experimental approaches and dead-ends
- Conceptualization of future directions
- Non-linear thinking and idea development

These documents are **living content** that evolves as the project progresses.

## Recent Research

### [Unified Grammar](unified-grammar.md)
Exploration of creating a unified grammar for knowledge representation, starting from Peano Arithmetic as a proof of concept.

**Topics covered:**
- Simple logic as grammar (Peano Arithmetic case study)
- Rewrite rule engine approach to theorem proving
- Beginning conceptualization of generalized logic systems
- Observation-based knowledge systems

## Research Methodology

1. **Start from Known Systems**: Begin with well-understood formal systems (e.g., Peano Arithmetic)
2. **Identify Core Components**: Break down systems into fundamental building blocks
3. **Extract Patterns**: Find common patterns across different systems
4. **Generalize**: Create abstractions that can represent multiple systems
5. **Validate**: Test generalizations with concrete implementations

## Future Research Directions

- Composite logical systems
- Knowledge representation for natural language
- Symbolic AI approaches to reasoning
- Integration of truthfulness and confidence values

## How to Contribute

Research documents are meant to be exploratory. Feel free to:
- Add your own experimental notes
- Propose alternative approaches
- Question assumptions and directions
- Connect ideas across different research documents

See [Unified Grammar](unified-grammar.md) for a concrete example of research documentation.
